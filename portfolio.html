                <b>Dental practice system: </b> This program provides a front and back end solution for the day to day 		workings of a dental practice. There are 3 users of the system: the secretary, the hygienist 	and the dentist, each having their own applications. The secretary can register a patient 		with the practice, placing them into a 3NF database. This then allowed the hygienist and 		dentist to view the dates and times for their appointments on individual calendars. After the 	patient has been seen, the hygienist and dentist can record what treatments they gave to 	the patient, and depending on what healthcare plan they’re on, adjust the bill of the 		appointment and print out a receipt. All of this gets committed to the database.

                <p><b>Wordsearch Solver: </b>Uses a set of training data and test data (in the form of an unsolved wordsearch) to automatically solve a wordsearch. I used principal component analysis to 	reduce the number of features used to 10 and to label each of the letters in the wordsearch, 	which, in the high resolution example was around 90% accurate, and in the lower resolution 	image around 40% accurate. The program then iteratively searched through the matrix of 	guessed letters to find the location of the words; when a word was found, it would draw a 	line over top the word.

                <p><b>The Enigma Machine: </b>This was a 3 part assignment, where I had to firstly create substitution ciphers, 	then develop the enigma coding machine (including cribs and menus) and finally create a 	program that was capable to breaking the enigma code. I developed the final assignment in 	a bottom-up approach, successfully being able to guess the correct offsets and stecker that 	the ciphered message had been encoded with; then deciphering it. I also conducted some 	scientific experiments with the completed program, successfully demonstrating the effects 	of reducing the length of the menu for encoding the message.

                <p><b>Online Food Ordering Application: </b>We developed an online food ordering system for a take away company. 		Customers could sign up to the website and be stored in the database, which automatically 	decided which menu would be displayed to them depending on their location. The user 		could order food by tweeting 	@CurryOnRails1 with their order and an employee would get 	a notification on the admin page stating what the client wanted. He could then confirm this, 	which would begin the delivery process. Once an order had been confirmed, the client 		would be tweeted the estimated delivery time depending on how far away from the 		restaurant they lived. Users could also take part in competitions, where if they retweeted 		the automatically generated tweet first they would win £5 credit on their account.
